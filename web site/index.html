    <h2 class="heading">what is the definition of computer?</h2>
    <article class="article-1">computer is an electronic device which takes data (as input),performs opreations(as
        processing) on that data and gives the result(as output) according to the given input.A computer is an
        electronic machine used to solve different problems according to a set of instructions given to it.A simple
        computer is composed of input devices,the central processing unit,output devices,primary/secondary storage
        devices and communication devices.</article>

                <li>A computer is used to solve problems for people by carying out instructions given to it.</li>
                <li>We can permanently store huge amount of data in storage medium of computer there is hard
                    disk,compact disc etc.Which can be used and modified in future.
                </li>
                <li>Computer is a fast computing device,it can perform various opreations within a second,which a human
                    being do in many hours.It can be used to solve different problems very quickly.</li>
                <li>The acuracy of computer is consistently high and the dgree of accuracy of a particular computer
                    dpends upon its design.Errors can be occured but they are mainly due to human rather than
                    technological weakness,for example if the input data is incorrect,in computer terminology it is
                    known as Grabage in Garage out (GIGO)</li>
                <li>As computer is a versatile machine,therfore we can perform different tasks one by one or
                    simultaneously on computer.</li>

A Mainframe computer can store large amount of data. It can execute about trillions of instructions per second (TIPS). HP 16500 series. HP Superdome, EC 12, and EC 196 are examples of mainframe computers. Following are the areas where Mainframe computers are used: </article>
